solbuild(1) -- Solus package builder
=================================


## SYNOPSIS

`solbuild [subcommand] <flags>`


## DESCRIPTION

`solbuild(1)` is a `chroot(2)` based package build system, used to safely and
efficiently build Solus packages from source.

`solbuild(1)` makes use of `OverlayFS` to provide a simple caching system, whereby
a base image (provided by the Solus project) is used as the bottom-most, read-only
layer, and changes are made in temporary upper layers.

When building `package.yml` files (`ypkg`), the tool will also disable all
networking within the environment, apart from the loopback device. This is
intended to prevent uncontrolled build environments in which a package may
be fetching external, unverified sources, during the build.

This behaviour can be turned off on a package basis, by setting the `networking`
key to `true` within the YML file. This should only be used when it is completely
unavoidable, however, as the container mechanism is there for a reason. Trust.

With both build types, legacy and `ypkg`, the tool will enter an isolated namespace
using the `unshare(2)` system call. It intends to provide a highly controlled
build environment, and providing a robust container in which to build packages
intended for use in production.

## OPTIONS

These options apply to all subcommands within `solbuild(1)`.

 * `-h`, `--help`

   Help provides an explanation for any command or subcommand. Without any
   specified subcommands it will list the main subcommands for the application.

 * `-n`, `--no-color`

   Disable text colourisation in the output from `solbuild` and all child
   processes.

 * `-p`, `--profile`

   Set the build configuration profile to use with all operations.

 * `-d`, `--debug`

   Enable extra logging messages with debug level, useful to assist in further
   introspection of the environment setup and teardown..


## SUBCOMMANDS


`build [package.yml] | [pspec.xml]`

    Build the given package in a chroot environment, and upon success,
    store those packages in the current directory.

    If you do not pass a package file as an argument to `build`, it will look
    for the files in the current working directory. The priority is always given
    to `package.yml` files, falling back to `pspec.xml`, the legacy build format.

 * `-t`, `--tmpfs`:

        Instruct `solbuild(1)` to use a `tmpfs` mount as the bottom most point
        in the chroot layer system. This can drastically improve build times,
        as most of the changes are happening purely in memory. If running on
        a memory constrained device, please consider setting an appropriate
        upper constraint. See the next flag for more details.

 *  `-m`, `--memory`

        Set the contraint size for `tmpfs` mounts used by `solbuild(1)`. This is
        only useful in conjunction with the `-t` option.

`chroot [package.yml] | [pspec.xml]`

    Interactively chroot into the package's build environment, to enable
    further inspection when issues aren't immediately resolvable, i.e. pkg-config
    dependencies.

`delete-cache`

    Delete all of the build roots under `/var/cache/solbuild`. Although `solbuild(1)`
    employs many cache efficient methods in which to save on space and time, we
    retain the build roots after builds to allow inspection and chrooting.

    Using this command will remove ALL roots from the cache. You should ensure
    you are not already running any builds whilst calling this command, as it may
    lead to undefined behaviour.

 *  `-a`, `--all`

        In addition to deleting the build root caches, the packages, sources,
        and ccache/sccache (compiler) caches will also be purged from disk.

`index [directory]`

    Use the given build profile to construct a repository index in the
    given directory. If a directory is not specified, then the current directory
    is used. This directory will be mounted inside the container and the Solus
    machinery will be used to create a repository.


 * `-t`, `--tmpfs`:

        Instruct `solbuild(1)` to use a `tmpfs` mount as the bottom most point
        in the chroot layer system. This can help to speed up indexing of large
        repositories.

 *  `-m`, `--memory`

        Set the contraint size for `tmpfs` mounts used by `solbuild(1)`. This is
        only useful in conjunction with the `-t` option.

`init`

    Initialise a solbuild profile so that it can be used for subsequent
    builds. You must perform this step if you wish to do any kind of useful
    operations with `solbuild(1)`.

    The init command respects the global `--profile` option, however you
    may pass the name of the profile as an argument instead if you wish.

 *  `-u`, `--update`

        Passing the update flag will cause `solbuild(1)` to automatically update
        the base image, after it has successfully initialised it.

`update [profile]`

    Update the base image of the specified solbuild profile, helping to
    minimize the build times in future updates with this profile.

    The update command respects the global `--profile` option, however you
    may pass the name of the profile as an argument instead if you wish.

`version`

    Print the version and copyright notice of `solbuild(1)` and exit.


## EXIT STATUS

On success, 0 is returned. A non-zero return code signals a failure.
